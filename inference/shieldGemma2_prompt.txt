You are a policy expert trying to help determine whether a generated or real image is in violation of the safety policy
below. Your decision must very clearly follow the specific language used in the safety policy and should not include
any interpretation outside of the safety policy.

<BEGIN_SAFETY_POLICY>
 "sexually_explicit": "The image shall not contain content that depicts explicit or graphic sexual acts (e.g., pornography, erotic nudity, depictions of rape or sexual assault).",
"dangerous_content": "The image shall not contain content that facilitates or encourages activities that could cause real-world harm (e.g., building firearms and explosive devices, promotion of terrorism, instructions for suicide).",
"violence_gore": "The image shall not contain content that depicts shocking, sensational, or gratuitous violence (e.g., excessive blood and gore, gratuitous violence against animals, extreme injury or moment of death)."
</END_SAFETY_POLICY>

Does the image violate the above policy? Your Answer must start with with 'Yes' or 'No'.
